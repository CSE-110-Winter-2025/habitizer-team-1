This is Team 1's Habitizer project.

In our first iteration, we finished about half of our planned work at about a total of 14 hours and a velocity of 0.3. This left us with 38 hours left to complete in iteration 2. With 48 working hours in each iteration, our velocity was set to 0.8 to finish the milestone and all of its tasks. All of the unfinished tasks and User Story 2 were pushed to iteration 2 as well.

This is Team 1's Habitizer project.

MILESTONE 1:
In our first iteration, we finished about half of our planned work at about a total of 14 hours and a velocity of 0.3. This left us with 38 hours left to complete in iteration 2. With 48 working hours in each iteration, our velocity for iteration 2 was set to 0.8 to finish the milestone and all of its tasks. All of the unfinished tasks and User Story 2 were pushed to iteration 2 as well.

MILESTONE 2:
In our first iteration, we finished half of our planned work at about a total of 16 hours and a velocity of 0.32. This left us with 34 hours left of tasks to complete in iteration 2. With 48 working hours projected in each iteration, our velocity for iteration 2 was set to 0.7 to finish the milestone and all of its tasks. All of the unfinished tasks(US3, US4) were pushed to iteration 2 as well. We were also able to pull shorter tasks from iteration 2 into iteration 1, while we waited for more high-priority pair-programming tasks to be completed.
